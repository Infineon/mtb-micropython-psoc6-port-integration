# This script will be use to set the dependencies version in the bsps deps/ folder.

# Why we need this script? 
# --------------------------------
# The ModusTooolbox sets a fix version for the bsp repo sources, but the version of the dependencies
# are not fixed. They are handled by the manifest system instead.
# As we are not keeping these bsps under version control, but we retrieve them when initializing
# the project, we will always get the latest version of the bsp dependencies (according to the manifest configuration).
# We donÂ´t want libraries to be updated without our knowledge, so we will set the dependencies version with this script.

# Move to the directory where the script is located
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
